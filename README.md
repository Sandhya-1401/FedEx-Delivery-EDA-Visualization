![FedEx Banner](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/FedEx_Express.svg/2560px-FedEx_Express.svg.png)

## 📦 Project Overview
This project explores a real-world logistics dataset from FedEx, uncovering insights into delivery delays, shipment modes, freight costs, and country-wise trends. Using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Plotly**, the goal is to turn raw data into a visual story that supports better decision-making.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**   
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for static visualization
- **Plotly** for interactive graphs
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Jupyter Notebook** for presentation

---

## 📁 Dataset Summary
- **Source:** FedEx Delivery Logistics (assumed)
- **Key Columns:**
  - `Shipment Mode`
  - `Delivery Delay (Days)`
  - `Freight Cost (USD)`
  - `Weight (Kilograms)`
  - `Product Group`
  - `Country`
  - `PO Sent to Vendor Date`

---

## 📌 Project Goals
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Create **20 meaningful charts** using:
  - ✅ Univariate Analysis
  - ✅ Bivariate Analysis
  - ✅ Multivariate Analysis
- Extract **actionable business insights**
- Present data using **interactive visualizations**

---

## 📈 Key Insights & Charts

### 🔹 Univariate Analysis
- Histogram & Boxplot of Delivery Delays
- Shipment Mode Distribution
- Top Countries by Delivery Volume

### 🔸 Bivariate Analysis
- Delay by Shipment Mode (Boxplot)
- Freight vs Delay (Scatter)
- Weight vs Shipment Mode (Swarm)

### 🔻 Multivariate Analysis
- Bubble Plot with Weight, Cost, Delay, and Product Group
- Stacked Bar (Shipment Mode % by Country)
- FacetGrid: Delay Histograms by Shipment Mode
- Line/Area plot for Trends

> 📍 **Each chart includes:**
> - Why this chart was used
> - Key insights gained
> - Business impact (positive/negative)
